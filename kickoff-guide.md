A kickoff party is a great way to get the season started. Here are some suggested activities for
starting an OGPC season. Take some of these ideas, optionally add pizza, and you have yourself
a kickoff party!

* Watch the [What is OGPC video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gr80Z8WEiys) and check out
  [projects from last year's competition](http://tms.ogpc.info/) to introduce new participants
  to the competition.
* Play some [Gamestorming]({% link gamestorming.md %})
* Deconstruct a game. This[ game analysis activity guide](assets/files/Game-Analysis-Activity-Guide.pdf)
  can help your group figure out what makes a game tick.
* The first four videos in this [Extra Credits playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjCY8StB1MxNkr-T3_ZGQ0o2dx7cWpz1N)
  should be considered mandatory viewing for OGPC teams. Watch one or more of them!
* Explore the resources on our [Resources Page]{% link resources.md %}
* If you already have a team formed, set up a profile in the [Team Management System (TMS)](https://tms.ogpc.info/)
* Check out the season documents. Make sure to review the competition manual for new rules.
* Generate ideas for this year’s competition. But don’t assume you need to come up with a final plan
  right away. Keep an open mind and try some ideas out before locking in on any one game design.
