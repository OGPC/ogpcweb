This is a list of resources OGPC recommends. If you are an experienced game developer, you may already have favorite tools and resources, but it is worth a quick scan to see if there is something you hadn’t heard of. If you are new to making games, these resources should help you get up and running. There are more useful tools and sites than we can possible catalog, and there are always new tools being created, so teams are also encouraged to do additional research before making any decisions about what tools and resources to use.

## Game Engines

Many teams at OGPC (especially those starting out) rely on a tool that is designed to help speed up game development. While experienced programmers may enjoy the challenge and experience of coding a game from scratch, it is not an easy task. Even professionals often rely on a game engine that handles many of the low-level details of running the game, freeing them up to focus on implementing the mechanics of their particular game.

### 2D vs 3D

Everything about developing a 2D game tends to be easier. From the art to the coding to the level design, there is just less to worry about. First time teams are STRONGLY recommended to make a 2D game before trying to move on to 3D.

### BASIC ENGINES – DRAG AND DROP CODING

#### [CONSTRUCT 3](https://www.construct.net/en)

*Free trial is feature limited – classroom use requires paid license; paid Full Version; Windows/Mac/Linux/iOS/Android/ChromeOS*

Construct is an HTML5-based 2D game editor that runs in a browser. Because it is browser-based, it can be used to edit games on any platform with a browser. Game logic can be built using a visual editing system or with javascript code.

#### [STENCYL](http://www.stencyl.com/)

*Free for personal use – classroom use requires paid license; paid version to target desktop or mobile; Windows/Mac/Linux*

Stencyl allows students to start to make a game with minimal programming by using predefined behaviors – first-time designers can just tell an object “you obey gravity” and it will start behaving according to prebuilt rules. Thus, if what a team wants to do is already supported by built-in behaviors, they will likely get farther faster. There is, however, a significant difficulty jump if custom behaviors are necessary. Code can be customized with either a drag and drop syntax that looks a lot like that of Scratch, or a text-based programming language.

#### [GAMEMAKER](https://gamemaker.io/en/gamemaker)

*Free for personal use – classroom use requires paid license; Windows/Ma/Linux; Chromebook Coming Soon*

GameMaker is a popular tool for making 2D games. New programmers can use the visual scripting system to start programming a game without writing code while experienced programmers can go under the hood to use the written scripting language.

Exporting a project to a web playable version requires a paid upgrade.

#### [SCRATCH](https://scratch.mit.edu/)

*Free Web-based (any platform)*

Scratch is designed to teach the basics of programming logic and problem solving using drag and drop coding. Although it can be used to create games, it was not designed for this purpose and thus there are some significant limitations (screen is a fixed size, projects can only be played on the web, et cetera) and some things that are “built-in” to more game-focused tools, need to be coded manually in Scratch.

### ADVANCED ENGINES

#### [GODOT](https://godotengine.org/)

*Free Windows/Mac/Linux*

Godot is an Open Source game engine for 2D and 3D games that allows for coding in a visual scripting system or C#. Although it doesn’t have all the features of Unity, its 2D engine has a reputation for being easier to use than Unity’s 2D system.

#### [UNITY](https://unity.com/)

*Free Windows/Mac/Linux*

Unity is a popular commercial/indie development environment and also popular among OGPC teams making the jump to 3D (though it can also be used for 2D). The Unity community is quite large and more experienced teams can find lots of help on their forums. Unity is programmed using JavaScript or C# and games can be exported to a variety of platforms.

#### UNREAL ENGINE/CRY ENGINE/SOURCE ENGINE

There are many other professional game engines that are available for free or at a reasonable cost. Often, programmers will need to know languages such as C/C++ and teams will need to have a very good grasp on programming and game design to make effective use of these tools.

## Game Design

Learning how to design a game is just as critical in OGPC as learning to use the tools that can help realize a design. Teams need to learn how to set goals that are manageable and design games in terms of their most important feature – player interaction. Here are some resources to help:

#### [OGPC GAMESTORMING](gamestorming)

A card game where you brainstorm about game design! [Check it out here](gamestorming).

#### [EXTRA CREDITS](https://www.youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz)

![Extra Credits Youtube channel](assets/images/extra-credits.jpg){: .float-md-end .col-md-4 .ms-md-2}

Hands down, one of the best resources out there for learning about designing games is the web series Extra Credits. They have 12+ seasons of episodes that cover a wide range of topics. [This playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjCY8StB1MxNkr-T3_ZGQ0o2dx7cWpz1N) contains some of the videos that we think provide the most bang for the buck for beginning designers. The first 4 videos especially should be considered mandatory viewing!

#### [GAME MAKER’S TOOLKIT](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337/featured)

A Youtube channel that focuses on deconstructing games to figure out what makes then work (or not).

#### [OGPC GAME DEVELOPMENT VIDEOS](https://www.youtube.com/user/McBacon1337/featured)

Follow Adam and Gabriel as they go from brainstorming and planning to designing and prototyping, and finally to creating an entry for OGPC.
