We live in a very connected world. We can collaborate and communicate with people all
across the planet in seconds with personal, internet-connected devices. Neurons in our
brains form our thoughts and memories. Our power grids send electrons all across the
country. Everywhere you look there are systems and processes that are built of
connections. Some connections are formed by people, others exist in nature. Some are
enormous, and complex. Others are small and simple. Think of a system of connections,
what does it connect? How can it fail? How can it be improved? The answers to these
questions can be starting points for a game's design.
