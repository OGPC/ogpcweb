Space is unforgiving and cold, though we can't help but find it fascinating. While we've had the
technology to travel to space for some time, no extraterrestrial journey is a casual affair.
Funding, training, engineering, construction, and time are all steep costs for even the smallest
of missions. However, we might be able to gain a lot from space as well, in the form of research,
exploration, resources, and maybe even colonization. In the distant future, who knows what could happen?

Teams will make a game exploring the challenges of space travel, space missions, or life in space.
Any type of game is acceptable, but interpretation of the theme must be apparent in all aspects of
a submission, whether gameplay, story, art, or sound.
