Heroes share many characteristics, but no two are the same. Some heroes have superpowers - but
not Katniss. Some heroes embrace their destiny - but not Frodo. Some heroes are selfless - but
not Iron Man. What makes Robin Hood a hero, for example? Can heroes do bad things, like stealing?

People in real life are often called heroes because of some especially courageous act. But what
about teachers or firefighters? Are they heroes every day, or just doing their job?

Think about who your heroes are, and what makes them special. What calls a person to act heroic,
or take a job that requires heroism on a daily basis? Is it part of human nature or is there some
other force that drives them? How do you define “hero”? How does someone become a hero?
