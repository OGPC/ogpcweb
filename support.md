Here are ways you can help.

## Volunteer

### For the main event

Every spring we need dozens of volunteers to spend a day helping make the Main Event happen.

Our greatest need is for judges. Fortunately it is also a really fun and rewarding job –
you get to spend the day playing student games and talking to the teams. Judges evaluate
teams and their products and give candid, constructive feedback directly to the teams.
There are multiple judging areas… so no matter what your professional background, there
will be something you are qualified to evaluate - you do NOT have to be a professional
programmer or game developer.

We also need volunteers interested in speaking to students. The idea of working in game development
and related fields seems like a dream to many of the kids. Hearing first-hand accounts of how
projects unfold, how teams work together, and what’s possible in the real world can help students
turn those dreams into concrete goals. To this end, we try to offer a range of professional speakers
every year in breakout sessions throughout the day.

Finally, we can always use more specialized skill sets. Are you a photographer or
videographer willing to document the event? If so, please get in touch!

If you are interested in helping in any of these ways, please get on our mailing list as a volunteer
to be notified each year when we start recruiting.

### Planning

OGPC isn’t just a one-day event. There’s marketing, sponsorships, outreach, web updates, software
development, event planning, and much more that needs to be done through the year.

OGPC is 100% volunteer run - it depends on people like yourself donating time to make all these
things happen. You can join the planning group to help year around, or chip in for a particular
project.

If you have some time you are willing to lend to the cause, please reach out to us at
[info@ogpc.info](mailto:info@ogpc.info).

## Sponsor

Putting on OGPC each year requires renting a facility, buying awards, and providing food to
volunteer judges, as well as basic organizational expenses like insurance and web hosting. Without
the financial support of individuals and corporations, the event would not be possible.

We are a tax-exempt 501(c)3 that is run entirely by volunteers – 100% of our funding goes to
events and expenses. We are committed to transparent operation and are
[GuideStar Gold Certified](https://www.guidestar.org/profile/47-5440436). Our tax ID (EIN) is 47-5440436.

You can support us with a tax-free donation of money or of products to use as giveaways for
participants.
