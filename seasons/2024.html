    <img class="theme-logo mx-auto d-block" src="/assets/images/season-logos/Cycles.png" alt="Cycles" width="500" height="419"/><p>Forests grow with underbrush competing for light, fast-growing softwood trees soon dominate
the precious sky, eventually, hardwood trees reach upward and monopolize the sunlight until
they die and the process starts all over again.</p>

<p>Water goes from the water table into lakes and rivers, evaporates into the air, is rained
down on the land, and runs back into bodies of water.</p>

<p>The moon endlessly transitions from a new moon to a full moon and back again. Meanwhile, its
motion and the rotation of the Earth combined to form an even more complex pattern of high
and low tides.</p>

<p>Over decades, the economy appears to be on a fairly consistent trajectory of growth. But
when we look more closely, things appear much more dynamic. Business activity periodically
passes through periods of expansion - where activity grows rapidly - followed by recession -
where activity decreases.</p>

<p>Various spiritual traditions believe in some form of reincarnation. Where existence is not
limited to a single lifetime, but is instead a progression of birth, growth, and death
throughout which a being slowly evolves.</p>

<p>Many aspects of the natural world and human activity operate in looping patterns. Patterns
where there is constant change, but those changes follow a predictable sequence - cycles.</p>

<p>This year’s theme asks you to explore one or more <strong>Cycles</strong>. Teams should be creative in their interpretation
and attempt to represent the theme in all aspects of a submission - gameplay, story, art, and sound.</p>

<h2 id="main-event">Main Event</h2>

<p>The Season 17 Main Event is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BKssiI_VWGeJjalkr6vD7_U5rIiXhOv1mNH8HDMwQmU/">May 18th at Western Oregon University</a>!</p>

<p>Registration for this year’s competition is now full. If you are just discovering OGPC,
we encourage you to start making plans for next year.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="new-this-season">New This Season</h2>

<p>Here is a quick summary of things that are new this season. Established teams and coaches, take note!</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMJrTvtWr2LY-qnr3kB2TzWVoGNlpu0rRiPcIAEUfww/view">Game Portfolio document</a>
you will use to collect various achievement-related artifacts in one place.</li>
  <li>One of the achievements involves doing some research on the Cycle(s) you are exploring in your game.
Make sure to check out the
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGullhrdGl1x5RV4CW4blkn7C_piGvjsaejmNtCyCsk/view#heading=h.2ok4e04iod0i">Research &amp; Development</a>
achievement early - you likely will want to work on it as you brainstorm.</li>
  <li>Before registering, you need to demonstrate that you have enough members for a team (though it
is fine to add more later) and that you have begun planning (but not necessarily building) a project.
See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YXN9DREiFG8eXpO2TpQ695vjUaRsZYC5n-OQWRGrEII/view#heading=h.tsawbjyed9d6">Competition Manual - Registration section</a> for details.</li>
  <li>There is a maximum of 5 teams per school/organization/coach.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>New to OGPC and trying to figure out how to get started? Here is a checklist:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Check out the Competition Manual to learn about the theme and how the actual competition works.</li>
  <li>Form a team. (The Competition Manual has requirements.) If you are a student, you will need to find
an adult who is willing to be the team Coach.</li>
  <li>Create an entry in the <a href="https://tms.ogpc.info/">Team Management System (TMS)</a> (Click the Help 
link at the top of the TMS page to see a video of the process). This involves:
    <ol>
      <li>The Coach makes an account and creates a Team.</li>
      <li>They then invite students to join.</li>
      <li>Students each make an account and accept their invite.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Do some research on the theme. (You will share this research in your Game Portfolio document as
part of completing one of the achievements.)</li>
  <li>Decide on what you want to build - fill out the Game Design Document portion of the Game Portfolio
(See Competition Manual for details.)</li>
  <li>Register for the Main Event. (See Competition Manual for details.)</li>
</ol>
