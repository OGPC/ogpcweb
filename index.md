## About OGPC

The Oregon Game Project Challenge is a video game development competition for middle school
and high school students. Each fall, OGPC announces a theme for that yearâ€™s competition. Teams
work to design a video game based on that theme to present at the main event in May.

OGPC uses student interest in making games to develop a wide variety of skills. Students write
code, create art and music, craft a story and design gameplay. They learn project management
and teamwork as they collaborate over multiple months to deliver a project. And they practice
their soft skills as they present their project to judges and other students.
